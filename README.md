## Background

In 1959 Edsger W. Dijkstra published a paper with an algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem [[1]](#1). Given two nodes within an undirected graph (with non-negative weights) find the shortest distance between them.

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm written in Java runs in O(|N|^2) time and uses space O(|N| +2|E|).
